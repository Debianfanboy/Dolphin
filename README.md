### An automatic video making software.

Dolphin is a framework where you can make videos fully automatically

Dolphin does this by allowing different modes for making certain types of videos.

Check out auto-video-maker to see how the tool works currently. Although auto-video-maker is an old repo and new updates will go to this one.
